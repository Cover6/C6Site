                    <p>I. You as a consumer of the Cover6 service are responsible for the monthly payments of your server. The only person allowed to make changes to the services purchased by the consumer would be the consumer him/herself. </p>
                    <p>II. If the consumer can't financially make their payments, the provider will then shut down any services given to the consumer until/if the consumer pays. </p>
                    <p>III. After payment, you have a 7 day money back guarantee clause. After your 7 days are up and you've hit the 8 day mark and you aren't satisfied with your service, you may cancel but no money return. Your service will also be available until the end of your term. </p>
                    <p>IV. Consumer agrees upon purchase that Cover6 is allowed to bill your account of purchase monthly, or custom plans. We grant customers a non-bill harassment after cancellation. Once the customer cancels their plan, they're
                        allowed to shut their services down immediately, or have it shut down at the end of their term. If the customer wants it shut down at a specific date within their term they may also do so. </p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Panel Use</h2>
                    <p>I. With the selected plans,("Savage, &amp; Anchor") you are entitled to a panel hosted by Cover6. This panel is not your property. When you cancel, everything in the panel is Cover6 property so you may
                        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> retrieve that. </p>
                    <p>II. A consumer may&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> use their panel to resell their service. If the consumer is guilty of this action, and their 7 day clause isn't up, they may have a refund. If their 7 day
                        clause is up profit will remain. </p>
                    <p>III. A panel is for the use of having the satisfaction of freedom. If you abuse your freedom with spam names or any other violation, your 7 day clause retract will take affect. </p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-center">Distribution </h2>
                    <p>I. Once a consumer purchases their product, they may not redistribution their service. If the consumer is found in this violation, and their 7 Day Retract is up, the consumers services will then be shut down immediately. </p>
                    <p>II. Every consumer is entitled to use their service for another community. If you profit using the services, you are allowed to do so. In the case you're trying to sell your services to someone else you're then in violation of the
                        "Distribution Clause" </p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-center">Term </h2>
                    <p>Upon purchase, consumer is entitled to a term. A consumer may, or may not have specific plan that allows him or her to a specific time.
                        The standard time for a service provided by us is a month which is also recommended. A term is from the time of purchase until the date discussed or chose is current. Upon your entitlement of a term it may be shortened upon violation
                        of any rules. If your 7 day retract is up and you're in violation no refund will be sent if your term is shortened. </p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-center">Violation </h2>
                    <p>A violation in our terms of service are taken very seriously. Within a violation of any of our terms your service will no longer be provided. If your 7 day retract is up, you won't get a refund with a violation. It only takes one violation
                        for a customer's service(s) to be shut down. If administration decides to not shut you down, Cover6 will have a brief investigation. Within the investigation, administration will discuss how the consumers services will
                        be watched. </p>
